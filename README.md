SO THIS IS MY BACKEND OF "Wavvy" WHICH IS MUSIC GUESSING SYSTEM WHICH DONT USE ANY ML CONCEPT JUST A GOOD DATA STRUCTURE KNOWLEDGE WHERE THESE IS A CONCEPT OF AUDIO FINGERPRINT 
THESE USES VARIOUS CONCEPT OF CACHING CELERY FOR FAST NON BLOCKING AND USING SOME THREADD FOR SYNC LIBRARY IT IS GENERALLY A GOOD PROJECT IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIMENT SOMETHING
AND IF YOU WANT TO ADD MORE FUNCTIONALITY YOU CAN ADD SEARCHING LOGIC WHICH USES FUZZY SEARCH etc...
